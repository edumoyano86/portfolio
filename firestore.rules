/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for EduMoyano portfolio application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for studies, projects, and skills,
 * ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data. Contact messages
 * are handled separately, allowing public creation but restricting access to authorized users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Studies: /users/{userId}/studies/{studyId}
 * - Projects: /users/{userId}/projects/{projectId}
 * - Skills: /users/{userId}/skills/{skillId}
 * - Contact Messages: /contact_messages/{messageId}
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data (studies, projects, skills) is exclusively accessible to the owner.
 * - Contact messages can be created by anyone, but listing and reading are not permitted in
 *   this prototype. Further access control for contact messages would need to be implemented
 *   based on specific application requirements (e.g., admin roles).
 * - No data validation is performed beyond authorization checks in this prototype phase.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The current structure relies on path-based ownership, so denormalization is minimal.
 *   If collaborative features were added, `ownerId` or `members` fields would be added to subcollections.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Contact messages are stored in a separate top-level collection to allow for different
 *   access control policies compared to user-owned data.
